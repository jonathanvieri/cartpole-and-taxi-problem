# Q-Learning_for_CartPole_and_Taxi_Problem

This is the instruction to run the code

To be able to run the code, you will need add one extra library.


How to install the library:

Torch: https://pytorch.org/
or
pip install torch===1.6.0 torchvision===0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html


## IMPORTANT
### Make sure you have all the libraries that are used (Most of them should already be installed in Python, since it come with them)
### Running the algorithm will make your computer lag if its not that strong (Takes a lot memory) 
### This is due to real-time plotting of the reward that the agent get


How to run all of the code:

1) Open the code in python compiler (Spyder recommended)

2) Change the episode values to your liking (I chose 250 episodes / steps)

3) Run the code and it should run the plot and the problem environment
